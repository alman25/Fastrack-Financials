Dashboard														
	Alex would like your help in creating a business snapshot dashboard that highlights key financial metrics.  														
	Your dashboard must capture the below:	
 
	-	"Cash on Hand: Display the amount of cash available for each month. 
Note: The changes in the current assets and liability balances (excluding cash) all took place in July 2023, there was no change in these figures between December 2022 to June 2023."					

	-	Budget vs. Actuals Variance: Present a comparison of the budgeted figures against the actuals for each month.		

 
	-	Expense Budget Utilization: Show the percentage of the overall expense budget spent so far during the year for any given month.					

 
	-	Gross Margin and Net Margin Trend: Visualize how the Gross Margin and Net Margin evolve over time.								

 
	-	Top 10 Vendors: Identify Alex's top 10 vendors and their total expenditure Year-to-Date (YTD) for any given month.						

 
	As you look at the data, you are also more than welcome to add additional charts and analysis that you believe would be useful.						

 
	Please ensure that the dashboard provides flexibility by allowing Alex to select the specific month he wants to view for each metric.
